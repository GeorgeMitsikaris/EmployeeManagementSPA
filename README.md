# EmployeeManagementSPA
This is a single page application which uses WEB API2 .NET and jQuery technologies to provide web services from an employee table. 
It does the basic CRUD operations and provides paging sorting and search functionality with autocompletion using the respective jQuery UI widget. 
The user can change the number of rows which are displayed. 
The ajax calls are done using jQuery. 
The table is as simple as possible but it's easy to add as many columns as it may be necessary.
